Download a copy of Neosay for your system by clicking the big green banner above.


## üöÄ Building It Yourself
To build Neosay, you'll need to clone the repository and build the binary:

```
git clone https://github.com/donuts-are-good/neosay.git
cd neosay
go build
```
## üìù Configuration (Environment Variables)
You may want to use Neosay with environment variables instead of a config file. 

```
echo "Hello, world!" | ./neosay
```

You can load in your configuration details as environment variables like this in your environment:

```
export MATRIX_HOMESERVER_URL="https://matrix.example.com"
export MATRIX_USER_ID="@yourusername:example.com"
export MATRIX_ACCESS_TOKEN="your_access_token"
export MATRIX_ROOM_ID="!yourroomid:example.com"
```


## üìù Configuration (JSON)
Neosay can optionally use a JSON configuration file to store the Matrix homeserver URL, user ID, access token, and room ID. This makes it easy to switch between rooms. 

**Note:** Be careful using this method, anybody can inmpersonate you with this information. It's best to make a different account for this.

Here's an example of the JSON configuration file:

```
{
  "homeserverURL": "https://matrix.example.com",
  "userID": "@yourusername:example.com",
  "accessToken": "your_access_token",
  "roomID": "!yourroomid:example.com"
}
```
## üåü Examples

### Sending a simple message
`echo "Hello, world!" | ./neosay config.json`

### Sending a multi-line message
`cat yourfile.txt | ./neosay config.json`

### Sending a code block
`echo "Hello, world!" | ./neosay -c config.json`

### Sending a multi-line code block
`cat yourcodefile.py | ./neosay --code config.json`
